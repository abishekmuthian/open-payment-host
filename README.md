## What
Open Payment Host is an easy to run self-hosted, minimalist Payments Host through which we can easily sell our digital items without paying double commissions while having total control over our sales and data.

## Why
Selling digital items on web as an indie requires using platforms where we have to pay double commissions(to the platform and the payment gateway) and our content is forever locked within those platforms.

## How
Open Payment Host is a minimalist yet highly performant Go web application with innovative features which helps indies self-host and sell digital items with little effort.

## Usage

### Requirements
1. [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account for payment gateway.
2. [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) account for turnstile captcha.
3. [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) account for adding subscribers to the list.

Note: Open Payment Host can be tested without fulfilling above requirements, But payments and adding subscribers to the list wouldn't work.

### Docker
The latest image is available on DockerHub at [`abishekmuthian/open-payment-host:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/layers/abishekmuthian/open-payment-host/latest).

The latest slimmed image is available on DockerHub at [`abishekmuthian/open-payment-host:latest-slim`](https://hub.docker.com/layers/abishekmuthian/open-payment-host/latest-slim)

### Demo Setup

```bash
mkdir oph-demo && cd oph-demo
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abishekmuthian/open-payment-host/main/samples/oph-demo/install-demo.sh)"
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`.

DO NOT use this demo setup in production.


**Login**:

The default admin email id is `test@test.com` and the password is `OpenPaymentHost`. You'll be asked to reset the password after login for security reasons. That password is hashed and stored.

You'll be logged out after changing password automatically to login with the new credentials.

Admin email id and Password can be changed in the config file (explained below) after the first run.

### Production Setup

It's recommended to try the demo application first before using the production application. The production application requires special config variables detailed in the configuration section.

```bash
mkdir oph-production && cd oph-production
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abishekmuthian/open-payment-host/main/samples/oph-production/install-production.sh)"
```
After the container has started successfully, Stop the container, Set the required production configuration and re-run the container.


### Configuration
Config file `fragmenta.json` is located in the `secrets` folder. It is generated automatically during the first run, After editing the config file the application needs to be restarted for the new configuration to take effect.

`fragmenta.json` contains configuration for both development and production. The production configuration is loaded when the environment variable `FRAG_ENV=production` is set.

Note: Environment variable for production is set automatically when using the docker production setup.

## Developer


### Build Open Payment Host

To build the application yourself,

```
$ git clone https://github.com/abishekmuthian/open-payment-host
$ cd open-payment-host
$ go build open-payment-host
```

There are `docker-compose` , `Dockerfile` files in the root of the project to build a docker image. The docker image can be secured and compressed using slim.ai as detailed in the next section(and shown in the Demo video at the start).

### Tailwind
Open Payment Host used Tailwind and Daisy UI for its UI. 

Compile Tailwind using the following command,

```
npx tailwindcss -i tailwind/tailwind.css src/app/assets/styles/app.css --watch
```

## Slim AI
Open Payment Host uses [slim.ai](https://slim.ai) to secure, harden and reduce the size of the container.

You can use the following tools to explore Open Payment Host container [on slim.ai](https://portal.slim.dev/home/profile/dockerhub%3A%2F%2Fdockerhub.public%2Fabishekmuthian%2Fopen-payment-host%3Alatest).

### Overview

slim.ai provides overview of the image to spot issues like **root user** and the size of the container image.

![Slim Ai Overview](/demo/slimai_overview.png)

### Vulnerability Scanner

slim.ai has multiple vulnerability scanners which scan for known vulnerabilities in the code of our container image.

![Slim Ai Vulnerability Scanner](/demo/slimai_vulnerability_scanner.png)

### Harden

slim.ai's harden feature reduces the overall size of the image by removing unwanted files and replacing bloated system files with hardened equivalent.

Open Payment Host image was compressed 91% using slim.ai tools.
